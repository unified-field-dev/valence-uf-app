## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security-sensitive reports.

Prefer one of the following:

2. Contact the maintainers privately via the repository owner listed at https://github.com/unified-field-dev/valence-uf-app.

Include:

- a description of the issue and its impact
- steps to reproduce or a proof of concept when possible
- affected crate names and versions

We will acknowledge receipt as soon as practical and coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline with you.

## Scope

In scope: vulnerabilities in this repository's published crates and documentation that could cause unsafe production defaults, plus CI/supply-chain issues in this repository.

Out of scope: vulnerabilities solely in third-party dependencies unless this project mishandles them in a security-relevant way.
